<para>This class allows application to access the data from game controllers of any type (joysticks, gamepads, racing wheels, etc). It provides discovery of the button configuration and axis layout and reports the status of the buttons and position of the axis. There is also support for enumerating the available controllers.</para>
<para>Joysticks can be accessed in two modes called standard and enhanced. The standard mode is for compatibility with the BeBox joysticks and is not implemented in Haiku. New applications should use the enhanced mode. </para>
